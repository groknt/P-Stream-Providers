# Flags

Flags are the primary way the library separates entities between different environments and indicates special properties of streams.

For example, some sources only give back content that has the CORS headers set to allow anyone, so that source gets the flag `CORS_ALLOWED`. Now if you set your target to `BROWSER`, sources without that flag won't even get listed.

Sometimes a source will block netlify or cloudflare. Making self hosted proxies on P-Stream impossible. In cases where it would break some user's experiences, we should require the extension.

## Available Flags

- **`CORS_ALLOWED`**: Headers from the output streams are set to allow any origin.
- **`IP_LOCKED`**: The streams are locked by IP: requester and watcher must be the same.
- **`CF_BLOCKED`**: _(Cosmetic)_ Indicates the source/embed blocks Cloudflare IPs. For actual enforcement, remove `CORS_ALLOWED` or add `IP_LOCKED`.
- **`PROXY_BLOCKED`**: _(Cosmetic)_ Indicates streams shouldn't be proxied. For actual enforcement, remove `CORS_ALLOWED` or add `IP_LOCKED`.

## How Flags Affect Target Compatibility

### Stream-Level Flags Impact

**With `CORS_ALLOWED`:**

- ✅ Browser targets (can fetch and play streams)
- ✅ Extension targets (bypass needed restrictions)
- ✅ Native targets (direct stream access)

**Without `CORS_ALLOWED`:**

- ❌ Browser targets (CORS restrictions block access)
- ✅ Extension targets (can bypass CORS)
- ✅ Native targets (no CORS restrictions)

**With `IP_LOCKED`:**

- ❌ Proxy setups (different IP between request and playback)
- ✅ Direct connections (same IP for request and playback)
- ✅ Extension targets (when user has consistent IP)

**With `CF_BLOCKED` _(cosmetic only)_:**

- 🏷️ Informational label indicating Cloudflare issues
- ⚠️ **Still requires removing `CORS_ALLOWED` or adding `IP_LOCKED` for actual enforcement**

**With `PROXY_BLOCKED` _(cosmetic only)_:**

- 🏷️ Informational label indicating proxy incompatibility
- ⚠️ **Still requires removing `CORS_ALLOWED` or adding `IP_LOCKED` for actual enforcement**

### Provider-Level Flags Impact

**With `CORS_ALLOWED`:**

- Source appears for all target types
- Individual streams still need appropriate flags

**Without `CORS_ALLOWED`:**

- Source only appears for extension/native targets
- Hidden entirely from browser-only users

### Embed-Level Flags Impact

**Embed flags work the same way as source flags** - they control embed visibility based on target compatibility. Unlike sources, embeds typically don't provide multiple stream options, so their flags directly determine if the embed is available for a given target.

**With `CORS_ALLOWED`:**

- Embed appears for all target types (browser, extension, native)
- Works across all playback environments

**Without `CORS_ALLOWED`:**

- Embed only appears for extension/native targets
- Hidden from browser-only users who can't bypass CORS restrictions

**With `IP_LOCKED`:**

- Embed requires consistent IP between request and playback
- Only works when `consistentIpForRequests` is true (typically extension setups)

**Embed flags are automatically derived from stream flags.** When building an embed scraper, the embed should have the same flags as its streams to ensure consistent filtering behavior.

### Important: Cosmetic vs Enforcement Flags

**Cosmetic flags** (`CF_BLOCKED`, `PROXY_BLOCKED`) are informational labels only. They don't enforce any behavior.

**Enforcement flags** (`CORS_ALLOWED`, `IP_LOCKED`) actually control stream compatibility:

- **Remove all flags**: Most common way to make streams extension/native-only (no browser support)
- **Add `IP_LOCKED`**: Prevents proxy usage when `consistentIpForRequests` is false (rarely needed - most extension-only streams just use no flags)

### The Golden Rule

**Extension-only providers:** Remove all flags (most common case) when streams only work with extensions (e.g., need special headers or IP restrictions that only extensions can bypass).

**Universal providers:** Include `CORS_ALLOWED` flags when using M3U8 proxies or streams that can work across all targets.

## Quick Reference

```typescript
import { flags } from '@/entrypoint/utils/targets';
import { createM3U8ProxyUrl } from '@/utils/proxy';

// Extension-only streams (MOST COMMON - just remove all flags)
return {
  stream: [
    {
      id: 'primary',
      type: 'hls',
      playlist: createM3U8ProxyUrl(originalUrl, ctx.features, headers),
      headers,
      flags: [], // No flags = extension/native only, but this case doesn't make sense because the stream is getting proxied.
      captions: [],
    },
  ],
};

// Universal streams with CORS support
return {
  stream: [
    {
      id: 'primary',
      type: 'hls',
      playlist: createM3U8ProxyUrl(originalUrl, ctx.features, headers),
      headers, // again listing headers twice so the extension can use them.
      flags: [flags.CORS_ALLOWED], // Works across all targets
      captions: [],
    },
  ],
};

// Direct streams (no proxy needed)
return {
  stream: [
    {
      id: 'primary',
      type: 'hls',
      playlist: 'https://example.com/playlist.m3u8',
      flags: [flags.CORS_ALLOWED], // Stream can be played directly in browsers
      captions: [],
    },
  ],
};

// Extension-only streams (usual approach - just remove all flags)
return {
  stream: [
    {
      id: 'primary',
      type: 'hls',
      playlist: 'https://example.com/playlist.m3u8',
      flags: [], // No flags = extension/native only (most common)
      captions: [],
    },
  ],
};

// Cloudflare-blocked streams with cosmetic label (if needed)
return {
  stream: [
    {
      id: 'primary',
      type: 'hls',
      playlist: 'https://example.com/playlist.m3u8',
      flags: [flags.CF_BLOCKED], // Cosmetic only - still extension/native only due to no CORS_ALLOWED
      captions: [],
    },
  ],
};

// IP-locked streams (when you specifically need consistent IP)
return {
  stream: [
    {
      id: 'primary',
      type: 'hls',
      playlist: 'https://example.com/playlist.m3u8',
      flags: [flags.IP_LOCKED], // Prevents proxy usage when IP consistency required
      captions: [],
    },
  ],
};

// IP-locked streams (when you specifically need consistent IP)
return {
  stream: [
    {
      id: 'primary',
      type: 'hls',
      playlist: 'https://example.com/playlist.m3u8',
      flags: [flags.IP_LOCKED], // Prevents proxy usage when IP consistency required
      captions: [],
    },
  ],
};

// Provider-level flags affect source visibility
export const mySource = makeSourcerer({
  id: 'my-source',
  name: 'My Source',
  rank: 150,
  flags: [flags.CORS_ALLOWED], // Source shows for all targets
  scrapeMovie: comboScraper,
  scrapeShow: comboScraper,
});

// Embed-level flags affect embed visibility
export const myEmbed = makeEmbed({
  id: 'my-embed',
  name: 'My Embed',
  rank: 150,
  flags: [flags.CORS_ALLOWED], // Embed shows for all targets
  scrape: async (ctx) => ({
    stream: [{
      id: 'primary',
      type: 'hls',
      playlist: createM3U8ProxyUrl(url, ctx.features, headers),
      flags: [flags.CORS_ALLOWED], // Stream flags should match embed flags
      captions: [],
    }],
  }),
});
```
